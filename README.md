# vue-ais-typescript
Test app with Vue, Algolia Instant Search, and Typescript

NOTE: This app was setup using Vue's new cli-3 (which is in beta). You may need that to run, you may not. If you have issues, take that into account.

Clone, or download the repo. `cd` into the directory.

`npm install` to download all dependecies

`npm run serve` to start a local server and view the application in your browser.
